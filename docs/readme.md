## Classes

### MKRIoTCarrier

Constructor of the object

```cpp
MKRIoTCarrier yourName; //In the examples we name it as *carrier*
```

Initialization example sketch

```cpp
#include <Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h>
MKRIoTCarrier carrier;

setup(){
Serial.begin(9600);
//This will adjust the sensitivity of the touch pads, not mandatory to set it, by default is false
CARRIER_CASE = false; 
if(!carrier.begin(){  //It will see any sensor failure
   Serial.println("Failure on init");
   while(1);
 }
}
```

### SD CARD
This can be accessed using the SD library commands that is already #included inside the library

The SD class initialized in the main `begin()`

The chip select (CS) pin can be known with SD_CS


**Syntax Example**

```cpp
#include <Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h>
MKRIoTCarrier carrier;

File myFile;

setup(){
   CARRIER_CASE = false; 
   carrier.begin();  //SD card initialized here
   
   myFile = SD.open("test.txt", FILE_WRITE);
}
```

### Buttons class

Init the calaibration and the set up for the touchable pads (Already done in the MKRIoTCarrier class' begin())
```cpp
Buttons.begin()
```
Read the state of the pads and save them to be analyze in the different type of touch events
```cpp
Buttons.update()
```

Get the status of the Buttons

Buttons selector from `TOUCH0` to `TOUCH4`

```cpp
Buttons.getTouch(TOUCHX)

Buttons.onTouchDown(TOUCHX)

Buttons.onTouchUp(TOUCHX)

Buttons.onTouchChange(TOUCHX)
```

In case you have another enclosure you can change the sensitivity of the pads, 50-255
Automatically configured when you set the `CARRIER_CASE` boolean, by default is false (sensitivity threshold 200)

```cpp
Buttons.updateConfig(int newSens)
```

#### Syntax example
```cpp
#include <Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h>
MKRIoTCarrier carrier;

void setup(){
   Serial.begin(9600);
   CARRIER_CASE = true/false;
   carrier.begin();
}

void loop(){
   carrier.Buttons.update();	// Read the buttons state
   
   //Check if the Button 0 is being touched
   if (carrier.Buttons.getTouch(TOUCH0)){
      Serial.println("Touching Button 00");
   }
   
   //You can replace getTouch(), with the other types of touch events
   //If you use more than one type of events in the same Button its not going to be stable, watch out
   //In case you need it, after each touch event make a Buttons.update() to read it correctly
}

```


### ButtonX class (**Deprecated**)

Button0 - Button4

Get if the pad is getting touched, true until it gets released
```cpp
ButtonX.getTouch()
```

Get when have been a touch down
```cpp 
ButtonX.onTouchDown()
```

Get when the button has been released
```cpp
ButtonX.onTouchUp()
```

Get both, touched and released
```cpp
ButtonX.onTouchChange()
```

In case you have another enclosure you can change the sensitivity of the pads, 5-255
Automatically configured when you set the `CARRIER_CASE` boolean, by default is false (sensitivity threshold 200)

```cpp
ButtonX.updateConfig(int newSens)
```

#### Syntax example
```cpp
#include <Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h>
MKRIoTCarrier carrier;

void setup(){
   Serial.begin(9600);
   CARRIER_CASE = true/false;
   carrier.begin();
}

void loop(){
   carrier.Buttons.update();	// Read the buttons state
   
   //Check if the Button 0 is being touched
   if (carrier.Button0.getTouch()){
      Serial.println("Touching Button 00");
   }
   
   //You can replace getTouch(), with the other types of touch events
   //If you use more than one type of events in the same Button its not going to be stable, watch out
   //In case you need it, after each touch event make a Buttons.update() to read it correctly
}

```

### Buzzer class

Equivalent to tone(), it will make the tone with the selected frequency
```cpp
Buzzer.sound(freq)
```
Equivalent to noTone(), it will stop the tone signal
```cpp
Buzzer.noSound()
```

### Relay class

Control both relays and get the status of them

You can control them by using `Relay1 `and `Relay2`

Swap to the NormallyOpen (NO) circuit of the relay
```cpp
RelayX.open()
```
Swap to the NormallyClosed (NC) circuit of the relay, default mode on power off
```cpp
RelayX.close()
```

Bool, returns the status LOW means NC and HIGH means NO
```cpp
RelayX.getStatus()
```

### DotStar LEDs

It is controlled with the Adafruit’s DotStar library

The documentation form Adafruit [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/arduino-library-use)

**Syntax Example**
```cpp
#include <Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h>
MKRIoTCarrier carrier;

uint32_t myCustomColor = carrier.leds.Color(255,100,50);

void setup(){
   CARRIER_CASE = false;
   carrier.begin();
   carrier.leds.fill(myCustomColor, 0, 5);
   carrier.leds.show();
}

void loop(){}
```

Some examples
Init the LEDs strip, done by default using the main begin()
```cpp
leds.begin()
```

Sets the color of the index’s LED
```cpp
leds.setPixelColor(index, green, red, blue)
```

In case you have custom colors you can use this method too
```cpp
leds.setPixelColor(index, color)
```

Set the overall brightness
```cpp
leds.setBrightness(0-255)
```

Update the LEDs with the new values
```cpp
leds.show()
```
 
Clear the buffer of the LEDs
```cpp
leds.clear()
```
 
Fill X amount of the LEDs with the same color
```cpp
leds.fill(color, firstLedToCount, count)
```

Save your custom color:
```cpp
uint32_t myColor = carrier.leds.Color(green, red, blue)
```

## Display

It is controlled through the Adafruit-ST7735-Library 

The resolution is 240 x 240.

Initialized inside the main `begin()`

Colors : every color with the prefix ‘ST77XX_’ i.e. ST77XX_BLACK. Colors available from the library are BLACK, WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW, ORANGE

In order to turn on the screen you will need to add this inside the setup()
(already inside the main begin())
display.init(240, 240);
pinMode(TFT_BLACKLIGHT, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(TFT_BLACKLIGHT,HIGH);

Colors : every color with the prefix ‘ST77XX_’ i.e. ST77XX_BLACK. Colors available from the library are BLACK, WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW, ORANGE

#### General:
    
Fill the entire screen with the selected color
```cpp
   display.fillScreen(color)
```

Get width and height
```cpp
   display.width() / height()
```

Rotates the coordinate system (number between 0 and 3)
```cpp
   display.setRotation(0-3)
```

#### Text:
Set the cursor to write text in the selected pixels
```cpp
   display.setCursor(screenX, screenY)
```

```cpp
   display.print(text)
```
It will print the string inside in the current cursor position

```cpp
    display.setTextColor(color)
```
Saves the selected color to print the text until the color is changed again

```cpp
    display.setTextSize(size)
```
Sets the size of the text that is gonna be printed

```cpp 
   display.setTextWrap(True/False)
```
Set the auto wrap of the text, if it is not the text will not jump to the next line.

#### Drawings:
Draw a Line from the start Vector to the End vector with the selected color, Use drawFastVLine() and drawFastHLine()             introducing the same settings, to avoid the agular calc.
```cpp
   display.drawLine(startX, startY, endX, endY, color)
```

Draw a Circle from the center Vector with the selected radius and color
```cpp
   display.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, radius, color)
```
   
Draw a rectangle
```cpp
   display.drawRect(topLeftX, topLeftY, width, height, color)
```

Draw a filled rectangle
```cpp
    display.fillRect(topLeftX, topLeftY, width, height, color)
```

Draw a filled circle from the center Vector, with the selected radius and color
```cpp
    display.fillCircle(centerX, centerY, radius, color)
```

Draw a rounded rectangle
```cpp
    display.drawRoundRect(topLeftX, topLeftY, width, height, curveRadius, color)
```

Draw a filled and rounded rectangle
```cpp
    display.fillRoundRect(topLeftX, topLeftY, width, height, curveRadius, color)
```

Draw a triangle by introducing the 3 points and color    
```cpp
    display.drawTriangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
```

Draw a filled triangle
```cpp
    display.fillTriangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
```

Draw a character
```cpp
    display.drawChar(topLeftX, topLeftY, character, color, backgroundColor, size)
```

Draw a bitmap, the bitmap needs to be with PROGMEM
```cpp
    display.drawBitmap(startX, startY, bitmap, width, height, color)
```
